1. Create data context
    1.1. Start with empty state ??? (or state with existing keys and empty values?)
    1.2. In the constructor of the App component fetch the categories data and setState state. Only after that pass data to navbar for categories and categories for routes

Only save data to context when currency is selected or the product is added to the card
