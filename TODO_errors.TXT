TODO: 
- The green button on the product card should add the product to the cart with the default attributes, not redirect to PDP
- The styling of currency switcher is wrong, the grey background should be on hover only
- The image slider in the cart is not implemented
- A brand is not added to the product card
- dangerouslySetInnerHTML should not be used

DONE: 
- The project is starting with the error, apollo/client should be added as a dependency, not installed on your computer globally
- Do not hardcode category-related data, all information should be received from the endpoint and rendered dynamically
- Add to cart is not working correctly, situation: Jacjets is in the cart, size, L, M, and XL, added one more M from the PDP, as a result, all jacket variants have quantity two, not only M
- Cart overlay should not be closed on - button click
- Remove reload of the page, it should be SPA
- Prices and total should be displayed as valid prices (with 2 decimals after the dot), check different currencies
- It should be possible to open the PDP of the out-of-stock product
- If only one item in the cart should be written 1 item, not 1 items
